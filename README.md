## Project Structure

- public/: Contains public resources such as index.html.
- src/: All source code, components, and styles are located here.
- assets/: Folder for images or self made fonts.
- components/: Folder for React components.
- styles/: Optional: CSS or SCSS styles.
- App.jsx: The main component of the application.
- index.html: The entry point of the application.

## Conventions

### File names
- React components -> PascalCase (Header.jsx, MyComponent.jsx)
- Styles and CSS files -> kebab-case (main-styles.css)
### React Components
- Prefer functional components over class-based components.
- Keep components small and reusable whenever possible.
### CSS Modules (Optional)
- For better style isolation, you can use CSS modules. Files should end with .module.css and be imported into the corresponding React components.

## Style Guide 
- HTML: Follow semantic HTML standards
- CSS: Follow semantic CSS standards
- Follow React best practices to structure your code
