Different Types of React Components:

JavaScript (JS) in React:
    This is standard JavaScript used in React to create components. It uses functions like React.createElement to build the UI. For example:

    function MyComponent() {
        return React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello, world!');
    }

JSX (JavaScript XML):
    JSX is a syntax extension that resembles HTML but is written within JavaScript. It simplifies writing UI elements and is compiled into JavaScript behind the scenes. Example:

    function MyComponent() {
        return <div>Hello, world!</div>;
    }

Key Points About React Components:
React components should always start with a capital letter.
React components must be imported before use in other files.
Components are functions that return JSX (which looks like HTML).
You need to export the component so it can be used in other files, like App.js.
