This folder is where you can store images used throughout your project. 
You can reference these images in your CSS or JSX files by providing the correct 
file path. For example, in a CSS file, you can use an image as a background like this:

background-image: url(../assets/images/background-image.jpg);

Make sure to adjust the url path based on the location of your CSS or JSX file in 
relation to the assets/images folder.
