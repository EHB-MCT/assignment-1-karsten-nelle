This folder is used to store custom fonts that you donâ€™t have immediate access 
to via a font family name. Once the font files are placed here, you can reference 
them in your CSS using the @font-face rule:
@font-face {
  font-family: "Your Custom Font Name";
  src: url(../assets/fonts/cascadiaMonoItalic-BoldItalic.otf);
}

Be sure to adjust the url path depending on the location of your CSS file 
relative to the fonts folder.
